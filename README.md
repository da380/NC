# Numeric Concepts

A collection of c++20 concepts for working with numeric types, which is to say integers, reals and complex numbers. 

The aim of the library is to collect a number of useful concepts in one place for inclusion in other projects. Some of the concepts are direct re-namings of those within the standard Concept Library, while the others are simple combinations thereof. Nonetheless, these are things I have found useful repeatedly.


## Inclusion in another CMake project

The library is best included using CMake's  Fetch_Content method. An example of this can be seen within the application directory.
